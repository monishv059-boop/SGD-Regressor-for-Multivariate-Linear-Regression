## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor
*Uses gradient descent optimization
*Efficient for large datasets
*Used to minimize loss function iterativel
2.Linear Regression
*Basic regression algorithm
*Models relationship between features and target
*Uses least squares method
3.Ridge Regression
*Linear regression with L2 regularization
*Reduces overfitting
*Works well with multicollinearity
4.Lasso Regression
*Linear regression with L1 regularization
*Performs feature selection
*Can reduce number of irrelevant features
